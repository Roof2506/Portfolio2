    <p class=>Hello,
      My name is <span style=color:red>Atticus Lim </span>, and I am currently pursuing a diploma in Digital Design and Development (DDDD) at Republic Polytechnic. With a strong passion for technology and design, I am working towards building a career as either a front-end developer or a game developer.
      I am continuously striving to enhance my technical skills and broaden my knowledge, particularly in game development, where I am currently expanding my expertise. As part of my professional development, I am also actively seeking internship opportunities to gain hands-on experience, refine my coding abilities, and build valuable workplace skills that will enable me to contribute effectively in the tech industry.
      Below, I have listed some of the key skills I have acquired throughout my studies and <a href="/projects">personal projects</a>.
